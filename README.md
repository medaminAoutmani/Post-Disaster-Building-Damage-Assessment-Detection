# Damage Detection Project

Satellite-image building segmentation project using the xBD disaster dataset.

The project builds a preprocessing and training pipeline for binary building segmentation from paired pre-disaster and post-disaster satellite images.

```

The raw dataset is intentionally ignored by Git with `.gitignore`.

## Stages

- Week 1: preprocessing, polygon parsing, mask generation, and visualization
- Week 2: first U-Net baseline training pipeline
- Week 3: improved baseline with dataset cleaning, BCE + Dice loss, more metrics, prediction visualization, and overfit testing

See `PROJECT_REPORT.md` for the full project report.

## Commands

Create dataset statistics:

```powershell
python src\week3_dataset_statistics.py --data-dir data --split train --output-dir outputs\logs
```

Train Week 2 baseline:

```powershell
python src\week2_train_baseline.py --epochs 5 --batch-size 4 --image-size 512
```

Train Week 3 improved baseline:

```powershell
python src\week3_train.py --epochs 20 --batch-size 4 --image-size 512
```

By default, Week 3 saves reproducibility artifacts to:

```text
results/week3/
```

This includes best metrics, training logs, training curves, qualitative prediction panels, model checkpoints, dataset statistics, and a failure-analysis template.

Run Week 3 overfit test:

```powershell
python src\week3_train.py --overfit-samples 8 --epochs 50 --batch-size 2 --small-model
```
